# hello-world
Herb Silverman 

Sooner or later, most ideas will change; it’s just human nature. My mission is to
touch one person at a time with a positive impact, transforming words into tangible actions.

To that end, I am a leader, networker, advocate, blogger, and author of a FREE e-Book
titled “UNMISTAKABLY HERB – Innovator. Problem solver. Change implementer. Stroke survivor.” Moreover, I explore change and viewpoints, squarely focused on areas of leadership,
productivity, salesmanship, adaptability, and humor.
